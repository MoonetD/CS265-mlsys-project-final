## [2025-05-12 18:52:56] DevOps Task: Profiler Enhancement for Stage 1
- **Status:** Success
- **Summary:** Modified `starter_code/graph_prof.py` to save detailed node and activation statistics to CSV files (`profiler_stats_node_stats.csv`, `profiler_stats_activation_stats.csv`). Added various plots including node runtime, node peak memory, activation memory size, activation inactive time, and a new "Memory vs. Execution Rank" plot with FW/BW separators and GPU memory limit.
- **Outputs:**
    - `profiler_stats_node_stats.csv`
    - `profiler_stats_activation_stats.csv`
    - `profiler_plots_node_runtime.png`
    - `profiler_plots_node_peak_memory.png`
    - `profiler_plots_activation_memory_size.png`
    - `profiler_plots_activation_inactive_time.png`
    - `profiler_plots_memory_vs_rank.png`
- **Next Steps:** Stage 1 deliverables are complete. Ready to review Stage 2 plan and begin implementation.
## [2025-05-12 19:12:03] DevOps Task: Profiler Model Switching & Refinement

- **Summary:**
    - Modified `starter_code/graph_prof.py` to use median for aggregated statistics.
    - Modified `starter_code/starter_code.py` to use ResNet-152 and BERT models.
    - ResNet-152 profiling completed successfully, generating CSVs and plots.
    - BERT profiling consistently fails with `aten._local_scalar_dense.default` error despite several attempts to adjust loss calculation and wrapper logic.
- **Outputs (ResNet-152):**
    - `profiler_stats_node_stats.csv` (reflects ResNet-152 run)
    - `profiler_stats_activation_stats.csv` (reflects ResNet-152 run)
    - `profiler_plots_node_runtime.png` (ResNet-152)
    - `profiler_plots_node_peak_memory.png` (ResNet-152)
    - `profiler_plots_activation_memory_size.png` (ResNet-152)
    - `profiler_plots_activation_inactive_time.png` (ResNet-152)
    - `profiler_plots_memory_vs_rank.png` (ResNet-152)
- **Issues:**
    - BERT profiling blocked by `aten._local_scalar_dense.default` error.
- **Next Steps:** Proceed with Stage 2 development focusing on ResNet-152 data. Defer further BERT debugging unless critical.
