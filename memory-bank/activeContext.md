# Active Context

  This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
* [2025-05-17 05:15:27] - Implemented `find_node_by_name` function in `starter_code/graph_rewriter.py`. The function now searches by rank using `activation_liveness` (specifically `creation_rank`) and falls back to name-based search, with appropriate logging.

## Current Focus
* Completed all required deliverables for the project
* Finalized experimental analysis document

## Recent Changes
* [2025-05-17 10:55:26] - Modified `activation_checkpointing_torch.py` to support both ResNet and Transformer models
* [2025-05-17 10:55:26] - Enhanced `run_test_torch.py` to generate comparison graphs for different batch sizes
* [2025-05-17 10:55:26] - Generated memory and time comparison images for both models in the final_images directory
* [2025-05-17 11:06:05] - Created comprehensive experimental analysis document (`final_images/experimental_analysis.md`) with memory profiling statistics, peak memory consumption comparisons, and iteration latency measurements
