Graph Extractor and Rewriter for Activation Checkpointing

This module implements Stage 3 of the activation checkpointing project:
1. Extracting subgraphs for activations marked for recomputation
2. Rewriting the graph to include these subgraphs in the backward pass

The implementation follows the approach described in the Î¼-TWO paper.
